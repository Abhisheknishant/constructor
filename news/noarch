* this utilizes a fundamentally different approach from before.  A standalone
  conda executable (created with pyinstaller) is used to create environments
  from packages that are shipped with the installers. This allows full support
  for everything that is supported by the standalone conda.  It does add some
  complexity in terms of menu creation and other operations that rely on
  knowing whether the env in use (the temporary env for the standalone exe) is
  the base env.  Let's call those prefix-based operations.
